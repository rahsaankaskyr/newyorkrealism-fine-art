Yuri Tsvetaev - Surrealism 

Yuri Tsvetaev was born in 1948 in Moscow. In 1972 graduated from the Bauman Higher Technical College. In 1992 graduated from Moscow Poligraphic Institute.

Since 1993 - member of Moscow Union of Artists. Without preconceived purpose, Yuri Tsvetaev begins drawing whatever the sacred moment inspires him to, and goes on working with open-minded spirit until the result is achieved. It is only afterwards that Tsvetaev observes what his inspiration has produced, and discovers his own painted commentary on human existence. It is an inscrutable process where thoughts are inexplicably living in shelter, where terrors disguise themselves as many-eyed twists of the mind, where mothers grow together with their dream fragments. And through it all, we can see the creation of growing relations between religions, economies and spirits of the times. The miniature paintings by Tsvetaev are creatures in their own right, of which he himself claims: "I am not the owner of my "creations"; most probably they are my lords, and if I am not painting them, it means that they have not invoked for me yet; and when it happens, I will feel it and start immediately."
