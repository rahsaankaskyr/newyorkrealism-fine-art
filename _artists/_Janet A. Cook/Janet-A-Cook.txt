Janet A. Cook - Realism

For Janet A. Cook the figure is an endless source of fascination and the most demanding of all subject matters. It’s "powerful, beautiful and timeless”. 


Working in the classic tradition of figurative painting, Cook is part of the growing numbers of women painting the figure. She draws inspiration from artists such as Rubens and Michelangelo go but her work retains a contemporary edge by combining the fluidity found in these old masters with a contemporary set of imagery that is not only from this world, but also from her imagination.  Abstraction, repetition, pattern and symbolism, are important components, but her ultimate goal is to intrigue and engage the viewer.


Museum shows include a four-person invitational at the Trenton City Museum, NJ, Mattatuck Museum Ct, National Academy Museum, NY, Hudson River Museum, NY, and the Maritiem Muzeeum of Vlissingen, Netherlands. Cook’s work was also featured on NBC's 'Dateline' program, the 'Da Vinci Code' and has appeared in the New York Times and reviewed in the Times of Trenton, NJ, The American Art Collector, The Pastel Journal, American Artist Magazine, the Gallery and Studio Magazine, The Times Square Chronicle, TheGreatNude.tv, Fine Art Connoisseur and The New York Optimist.  


Over the years she has received many awards for excellence, including a Gold and Silver medal from the Allied Artists of America, the Salmagundi Arts Club , NYC., and Best in Show, at the Catherine Lorillard Wolfe Art Club. She is an elected member of the Salmagundi Club, Pastel Society of America, Catherine Lorillard Wolfe Art Club and The Allied Artists of America.
