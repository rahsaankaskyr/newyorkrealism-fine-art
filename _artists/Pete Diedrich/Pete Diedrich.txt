Pete Diedrich - Realism, MFA. San Francisco Academy of Art University


I gradated from the Academy of Art University and I am a creative professional.
Lately I have been creating more work in a decidedly scientific fashion. 
I always loved the drawings of the "Old Masters" with an espcial appreciation 
for anatomy. But straight up scientific rendering can get boring. 
So I figured it was time to start the (almost) scientific art I wanted to see. 
I am doing this not so much for learning or teaching, but because its (hopefully) accurate with a (hopfully) nice design. And since I love chiaroscuro, I incorporated that too.
