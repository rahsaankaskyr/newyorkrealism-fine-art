Eleanor Mill - Realism

I am a graphic artist and watercolorist. Watercolor also refers to graphics, but to me it is an independent branch, which has its own character: ease, transparency, different color and light effects that are possible only in this style.

It depends on what material can express my impression better at a certain moment. 

I am keen on experimentation and I am constantly searching for new ways of artistic expression. I use several materials or a single one. It depends on what material can express my impression better at a certain moment.

Even when traveling I always take several sketchbooks in various formats and with different paper, as well as ink, watercolor, feathers, liners, pastel, charcoal ... I do not want to set any limits to my creativity. Designing taught me to be in constant search, to revise my outlook on things, their combination and their role in the world around.

Traveling is a vast source of inspiration for an artist. Discovering the diverse world with its peoples and cultures opens new perspectives. Every city has its special portrait features which an artist captures through his or her subjective opinion and displays to the audience.



I go hiking and do live sketches capturing the things that I admire. Sketching while traveling is a special kind of exploration of a new space, a subjective opinion expressed by the artist through different styles and accents. An ordinary photograph captures the moment and a work of art is an opportunity to view the world through the eyes of the artist. Similarly, sketches represent my subjective opinion and capture my personal impressions.

Then I go back to the studio and work on large formats, using a stack of sketches, which are best at retaining my emotions. The things that I create become a part of me. 


How rich is the world we live in! That is something I aspire to illustrate.
