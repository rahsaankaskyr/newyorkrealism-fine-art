Berik Kulmamirov was born in Kazakhstan. In 1981, he graduated from the Fine Arts College of Almaty.

Berik's earlier works were closer to realism, but the vogue of the nineties, which favored symbolic abstraction, had its effect on the artist.

Immigrating to the U.S. has changed his artistic direction. The country, with its diverse ethnic and cultural landscape, has broadened his area of interest.

The surrealism of his paintings gradually began to merge into realism reflecting a philosophy of his inner world. The connection between the cultures of nomads and the inhabitants of North and South America expanded his horizons, which is reflected in the paintings; they have became whole. During the period 1998-2007, Berik had participated in numerous art exhibitions and was a bronze-medal finalist in the Orange County Art Federation Competition in 2003.
