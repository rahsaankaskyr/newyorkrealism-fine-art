Olga Radjapova - Impressionism

My creativity rests on modern impressionism. I work in pasties pallet-knife techniques with optimum textures on canvas. The subjects of my works are decorative still-life and landscapes. 
Since childhood I have dreamed of becoming an artist. I have always wanted to freeze the moment, to project ideas on paper or canvas: the light of a dawn with the shimmer of dew on a blade of grass, the color of the fallen leaves in the autumn. 
I have graduated from the Fine Arts College of Tashkent and from the Institute of Theatrical Arts, specializing in design. My teachers have made a huge contribution to my creativity. School has also affected my development and my vision of the world. My idols are Vincent Van Gogh and Vrubel, an incredible Russian painter. 
Since the end of the last year, I have gained some publicity in the US, in a New York magazine "Gallery & Studio". I am very pleased that my works have aroused great interest among American art collectors.
