Bekzot Kobilov - Realism

I was born on October 11, 1986 in Bukhara City, Uzbekistan.

I studied at the NATIONAL APPLIED ARTS College from 

2002 to 2005. I graduated from the faculty of GRAPHIC ART at Bukhara State University. 

I started my craft in  early childhood. When I was 5 years old, I started painting in my brotherâ€™s school notebooks. When I was 11 years old, my father introduced me to my uncle Babur Kabilov, who was a local master-miniaturist. This is where began my studies in drawing  and eastern miniatures.

From 1997 to 2007, I developed, worked and improved my skills in the Art of Oriental miniatures. During those years, I have participated in numerous art competitions and exhibition in Bukhara and Tashkent city. During 2006 2007 I won a competition for young initiative "The Voice of the Future" and other children's contests. Over the years,I have participated in international exhibitions, and festivals.
