Ulughbek Mukhamedov was born in 1969 in Tashkent (Uzbekistan). He graduated from Benkov’s School of Art (Tashkent). He is a member of member of the Academy of Art of Uzbekistan since 2000. He works and lives in Bukhara. Ulughbek has worked out a unique techique of "black tea" to describe the peculiar atmosphere of old Bukhara.

“Ulughbek Mukhamedov is a rare art phenomenon. It is no coincidence that Ulughbek’s works amaze even the worldly-wise artists.

His filigree technique and his ability to reproduce a deep content by some artistic means startle people in his watercolors. That’s why Ulughbek’s tiny works look like the big epic canvases, which tell us about the people of Uzbekistan, their history and culture."
