Leila R. Elias - Fantasy Realism






Leila Elias' work is a combination of mixed media and painting, centering on the use of various textures. Her inspiration comes from nature and found objects; she incorporates twigs, broken glass, shells and recyclable items into her work. The love of experimentation with many textures leads her into the creation of dimensional paintings with a sculptural effect. She also uses elements of collage, creating a dream like quality to her work. 
She received her BFA from Adelphi University, Long Island, New York. In addition she has also studied at the Arts Student League in Manhattan and has taken classes focusing on textile design at Fashion Institute of Technology.
