Wladimir Tasoff - Fantasy Realism

Was born in Russia in 1970. I graduated from Academy of Architecture in Volgograd (Russia) in 1996. My first personal exhibition was in 1999 in the City Volgograd

in the Show-room of Soyuz of the Writers. Then I exhibited in many different galleries in Moscow, Stockholm, Dublin, and Quito.

Now I dwell and work in Quito the capital of Ecuador and have my own school of classic painting - first and alone in Ecuador.
