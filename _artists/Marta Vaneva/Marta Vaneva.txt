Marta Vaneva - Fantasy Realism

My work is about landscape. It is a confrontation between the natural form and the geometrical form of the Cube. All my landscapes are imaginary. My work is embracing the spontaneous gesture of the painting and the constructive form of the Cube. I work in Acrylic. Cinematographic pictures inspire me and that's why I usually use a panoramic shape of canvas.
I started to paint at the age of 6 and never stopped since. I graduated at the University of Pari-8 (one of the Sorbonne's Universities). I had a few exhibitions in Paris and Europe and lately in the US, New York. I'm still showing permanently my work in Toast gallery and Art Generation in Paris.
I also am graduated from the school of Boulle in Graphic design and I tried to upgrade my knowledge about computer arts. My interest in geometry, and geometrical forms or the cube comes from 3d environment. The Cube is the base of everything.
My favorite masters are Rembrandt for his light, Francis Bacon for his colors and many more...
